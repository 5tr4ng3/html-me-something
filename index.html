                    <h3>Chapter One: The Lonely Duckling</h3>
                    <p>When ducky was still an egg he rolled out of the nest 
                        into the cold rain. When the time came his brothers 
                        and sisters all hatched but not Ducky he needed more 
                        time. His momma waited a while before she eventually 
                        left because she thought Ducky didn't make it. But 
                        Ducky did make it and when he hatched his momma was
                        gone and he was all alone. Because momma duck had left
                        Ducky ended up imprinting on a frog.</p>

                    <h3>Chapter Two: The Best Frogling Duck</h3>
                    <p>Ducky wondered and wondered looking for his mommy but 
                        instead of momma duck he found daddy frog. Ducky
                        imprinted on this frog and followed him everywhere.
                        Ducky croaked like a frog, swam like a frog, ate like
                        a frog. He even hopped like a frog. Ducky was the best
                        frogling duck there was, probably because he was the
                        only frogling duck around.</p>
